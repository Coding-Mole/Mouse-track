# Mouse-track
This Python code uses the kivy module. When you run the file, it will take a while to load. Wait until a black window shows and then hover your mouse over the black screen and press left mouse button. Still holding the left mouse button, drag mouse across black screen and watch the trail. Enjoy! ðŸ˜‰
